Need create a new repo with unique name in main branch.
Then we need clone it to our local machine.
In order to clone this new repository to our local machine we need create a new directory or we can use existed directory.
mkdir <newd irectory>
cd <new directory>
git init >>>>>> Need initialize if you created new directory. You don't ave to initialize if you using existed and already initialized directory.
